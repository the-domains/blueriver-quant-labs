  July 11, 2016 Guest Post by Zach Wade, Founder and Chief of Experiments at
  Blueriver Quant Labs In the first half of 2016, RealMassive data revealed that

  insensitive to moderate price increases, likely because space remains a
  bargain compared to space in primary markets like New York and Boston.
