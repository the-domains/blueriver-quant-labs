  July 11, 2016 Guest Post by Zach Wade, Founder and Chief of Experiments at
  Blueriver Quant Labs In the first half of 2016, RealMassive data revealed that
  demand for Raleigh-Durham office space is quite inelastic. Tenants appear
  insensitive to moderate price increases, likely because space remains a
  bargain compared to space in primary markets like New York and Boston.
