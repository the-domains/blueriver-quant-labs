  July 11, 2016 Guest Post for RealMassive by our Founder and Chief of
  Experiments @ Blueriver Q-Labs, Zach Wade: In the first half of 2016,
  RealMassive data revealed that demand for Raleigh-Durham office space is quite
  inelastic. Tenants appear insensitive to moderate price increases, likely
  because space remains a bargain compared to space in primary markets like New
  York and Boston.
