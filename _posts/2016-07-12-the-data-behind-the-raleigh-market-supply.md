In the first half of 2016, RealMassive data revealed that demand for Raleigh-Durham office space is quite inelastic. Tenants appear insensitive to moderate price increases, likely because space remains a bargain compared to space in primary markets like New York and Boston. There's no shortage of young talent, which supports the argument that Raleigh-Durham is entering the class of 18-hour cities.

For context, [Blueriver Quant Labs][0] estimates that, on average in the first half of 2016, a 1% increase in price for commercial office space in Austin, TX corresponds to a 1.14% decline in demand. As we enter summer, Austin demand is turning more inelastic (whereby demand is expected to drop by less than 1% for a 1% price increase), but not much more. Austin, the poster-child of 18-hour cities, seems to have reached a steadier state of supply-demand dynamics than Raleigh-Durham. As Raleigh-Durham enters the scene as an [18-hour city][1], we'd expect constraints on the supply side of the market. This may explain why Blueriver Quant Labs detects little price sensitivity on the demand side. Startups hungry for space and established firms hungry for millennial talent compete for space, leaving market power firmly in the grip of landlords until developers fill the gap.

### Supply Data Distribution

Since the data suggests the Raleigh-Durham market is supply constrained, it's useful to look at the distribution of available office spaces by asking rent and square footage, as presented in the following figure. The left panel shows the distribution of available space by asking rate and square footage in the first half of 2015, the right panel for the first half of 2016\. The figures show how available space is clustered by rate and size, whereby the height of the peaks corresponds to the number of spaces at a given (rate, size) coordinate. Note that the topography of the 2015 Raleigh-Durham office space supply features considerably more dispersion than in 2016 -- the inventory is more diverse, with more size and price-point options. The supply in 2016 consolidated at a higher average rate (up from $11.14 to $12.45) and a larger square footage (up from 15.0k to 18.4k SF) for the most common space available.

RealMassive data is valuable for anyone interested in understanding the composition of the Raleigh-Durham supply in more depth. Investors & developers can use the data to understand why supply consolidated in 2016\. Was it due to property-managers modifying space to meet demand or the result of the most in-demand spaces getting absorbed? In a supply-constrained market the former seems most likely, but let's examine each in turn from a CRE professional's perspective.

### Why did Supply Consolidate?

Consider this case: what if supply consolidated to a higher rate and square footage due to property managers altering existing spaces (for example, combining existing spaces to make larger ones) to meet the desired specifications of prospective tenants? This would be useful information for a developer looking to relax the supply constraints of the Raleigh-Durham market, as it provides a baseline target for space sizes and corresponding willingness to pay. If this scenario and hypothesis reflect reality, they reveal that prospective tenants aren't so strapped for space that they need to settle or reduce standards, even though supply is constrained.

Note that the average rate per square foot increased ($11.14 to $12.45) in-step with the average square feet demanded (15.0k to 18.4k SF) among [properties][2] tracked by RealMassive from 2015 to 2016 . In other words, landlords are not providing volume discounts, but instead benefit from leasing more space at higher rates per tenant. Such intel is key for CRE investors, as it dictates two possible strategies for realizing healthy long-term returns in the Raleigh-Durham market. The first strategy is to search for existing buildings that could be re-purposed -- the data reveals willingness to pay for the right space, meaning that an investor may find positive NPV building restorations today that were negative NPV projects in the past. The second strategy would be to invest in new development projects, particularly ones that focus on accommodating the [preferences][3] of high-growth and youthful firms found in 18-hour cities.

### Another Example

What if, instead, the consolidation was due to the most in-demand spaces getting absorbed? In this scenario, the greater variety of space size and cost combinations would indicate a less supply-constrained market in 2015\. The decrease in space size and cost variety (consolidation) would suggest that the most in-demand spaces were absorbed, leaving a high concentration of less desirable space varieties in 2016\. That is, the spaces around 15k SF in 2015 were the most in-demand, while the consolidation at 18k SF in 2016 is the result of those smaller spaces getting rented. The first scenario, where consolidation is a result of asset managers modifying spaces is more plausible. Understanding this distinction is key for both for developers looking to build the most desirable product and for investors buying into existing buildings. This is where the granularity of RealMassive data can play a big role in market due-diligence. Blueriver Quant Labs used the same data to determine a fundamental statistic of the market, that demand is inelastic, and to infer that even though landlords hold most power in this supply-constrained market, prospective tenants remain picky.

The next step is for CRE professionals to use the same data to closely look at individual buildings that meet an investment criteria and make a call about the nature of the consolidation we're seeing before placing any bets.
